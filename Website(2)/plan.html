<h2>Goals</h2>
<p>The intended goal of the website is to get more people attending the monthly parties, and to get more people ordering costumes.</p>
<h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
<p>the success of the website will be evaluated by recording the number of people attending the monthly parties, and the amount of costumes that are ordered. if the numbers of attendance and orders show a noticeable increase, the website will be succesful.</p>
<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p>the target audience would be men and women in the 18-35 years age group. the site will be designed to cater to this group by using flat design elements, i.e. the absence of glossy or three dimensional graphical elements, as this type of design tends to be more appealing to a younger audience.</p>
